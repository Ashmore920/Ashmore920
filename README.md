- 👋 Hi, I’m @Ashley Moore
- 👀 I’m interested in learning to code.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, very slowly.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing because I don't know much at all yet. But would love to hear any advice on how to learn it easier and for free. I have alot of trouble learning, I have ADD and BPD and feel frozen andunmotivated but really wanna learn. A study buddy to keep me accountable wld be great!
